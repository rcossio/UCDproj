ML line:
- Check data

Rosetta line:
- Re-include muscarinic receptors as sets4 and 5
- Find a way of evaluating the result, check PPI-Affinity

Other options:
- Evaluate the option of simply using the original pepticde backbone, erase the side chain and mutate them to use flexpepdock/flexpepbind.
The problem is choosing which papetides can be used. It doesn't make sence to replace a regurar peptide with a proline since it affect the backbone.
Also it doesn't make sense to do it with proteins that have important parts missing.
