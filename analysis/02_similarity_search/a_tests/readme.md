In this folder are the scripts to test Blast, Smith-Waterman.
In order to not save unused data we have removed the results generated by them.
Warning: The scripts are old and folders have been renamed, so they cannot be runned withou a careful look.

You will find:

- history.sh: useful command that were runned
- run_*.sh: the script to write each program (currently only run_abblast.sh is considered checked and useful)
- filter_blast.py: script to filter after getting the alignment results (currently only mind about filter.abblast.py)
